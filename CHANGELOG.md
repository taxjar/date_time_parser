# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add `parse/2` that will respond with the best match. This function accepts all
    options introduced below.
- **BREAKING** Change `parse_datetime` to no longer assume time. Previously, it
    would assume `00:00:00` if it could not be parsed. This is replaced with an
    opt-in option `assume_time`. See next point. If you relied on , to upgrade
    add the option; eg: `DateTimeParser.parse_datetime(string, assume_time:
    true)`
- Change `parse_datetime` to accept options:
  - `assume_time: true | %Time{} | false` with the default of false.
- **BREAKING** Change `parse_date` to no longer assume a date. Previously, it
    would assume the current date, and replace the found information from the
    string. This is replaced with an opt-in option of `assume_date`. See next
    point. If you relied on this, to upgrade add the option; eg:
    `DateTimeParser.parse_date(string, assume_date: true)`
- Change `parse_date` to accept options:
  - `assume_date: true | %Date{} | false` with the default of false.
